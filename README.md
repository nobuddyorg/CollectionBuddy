# CollectionBuddy

A web-app catalog for your collected items üóÇÔ∏è

## Motivation

This project was created to provide a simple and elegant solution for cataloging personal collections. Whether it's stamps, coins, or any other collectible, CollectionBuddy helps you keep track of your items in an organized manner.

## Usage

### Development

To run the application in a development environment, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the `web` directory:
    ```bash
    cd web
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the `build.sh` script from the root directory:

```bash
./build.sh
```

**Note:** A production build requires the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables to be set. These can be obtained from your Supabase project dashboard.

The static files will be generated in the `docs` directory, ready for deployment.
